# Droid Controller

Droid Controller is an Android application designed to control the C1-1OP (Chopper) droid via Bluetooth, it can be used for others droids as long as they use a similar version of the receiverMCU. The app provides an intuitive interface for sending commands, macros, and audio triggers to the droid's ESP32 receiver using JSON-formatted messages.

## Features

- **Bluetooth Connectivity:**  
  Connects to the droid's ESP32 receiver for wireless control.

- **Manual Controls:**  
  Control movement, lights, and other actuators directly from the app.

- **Macros:**  
  Create and execute sequences of commands for complex actions.

- **Audio Commands:**  
  Trigger audio playback on the droid.

- **Status Monitoring:**  
  View connection status and receive feedback from the droid.

## Communication Protocol

- Uses JSON messages over Bluetooth to communicate with the ESP32 receiver MCU.

## Supported droids

Most droids run a single all-in-one receiver firmware. **Grogu is different** —
it has no audio hardware and its motion is split across two firmware boards
(`grogu_mcu_receiver` for BLE + wheels, `grogu_servo_controller` for servo
animatronics, linked over ESP-NOW).

See **[docs/grogu-setup.md](docs/grogu-setup.md)** for how those two projects
work together and a basic end-to-end setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android device (Android 8.0 or higher recommended)
- C1-1OP droid with ESP32 receiver MCU configured for Bluetooth communication

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/andcoderes/Droid_Phone_Controller.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on your Android device.

### Firebase (optional)

Crashlytics and Analytics are wired up only when `app/google-services.json` is
present (that file is gitignored because it contains a Firebase project id and
API key). Without it the app builds and runs normally, just with no telemetry.
To enable it, drop your own `google-services.json` from the Firebase console
into `app/`.

### Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Pair with the droid's ESP32 receiver via Bluetooth.
3. Use the interface to send commands, run macros, or trigger audio.
